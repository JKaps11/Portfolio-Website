          Hi, my name is Joshua Kaplan. I'm a fullstack developer who started coding at the age of 12 and stuck with it because I love exploring the complexities of computers.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          I recently graduated from the University of Connecticut with a degree in computer science and engineering, concentrating in software engineering. Through my projects, I've become proficient in web developmentâ€”specializing in React, TypeScript, and Python.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          When I'm not programming, I like to play sports, read, study history and philosophy, and cook. If you would like to meet, send me an email, and we can schedule a meeting!
